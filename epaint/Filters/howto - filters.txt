Creating your own filters:

It's quite simple...

All you have to do is take your gfx application and make it load a given filename on load (use command$)
Then modify the image as you want to, and save the file to the original file name (the one you got from command$)

Then compile and place the .exe in here (the epaint\filters folder).

Have fun!
